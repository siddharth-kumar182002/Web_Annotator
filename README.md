# Webpage Annotator Chrome Extension

The Webpage Annotator Chrome Extension is a powerful and intuitive tool designed to enhance your web browsing experience by allowing you to highlight text and add notes directly on any webpage.

One of the primary features of this extension is the ability to highlight content. Users can easily select text on any webpage and highlight it using customizable color-coded highlights. This feature is particularly useful for marking important sections of text, making it easier to find and reference critical information later. The color customization options allow users to choose colors that best suit their preferences, ensuring that their annotations are not only functional but also visually appealing.

In addition to highlighting, the Webpage Annotator Chrome Extension allows users to add notes. This feature is perfect for those who need to attach contextual information to their highlights. For instance, while reading an article, you might want to add personal insights, comments, or additional information that can be referenced in the future. The ability to add notes directly on the webpage makes this extension an invaluable tool for deepening your understanding of the content you are engaging with.

A standout feature of this extension is its persistence. Annotations, whether they are highlights or notes, are saved and remain intact across browser sessions. This means that even after closing and reopening your browser, all your highlights and notes will still be there. This feature ensures that you can continue your work seamlessly without having to worry about losing your annotations.

Another useful feature is the ability to delete annotations. If a particular highlight or note is no longer needed, users can easily remove it by right-clicking on the annotation. This keeps your annotations relevant and prevents clutter, ensuring that your workspace remains organized and efficient.
